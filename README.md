## What is Lindesnes?

Lindesnes is a collection of principles that guide and align people in how to use information technology (IT) to enable a learning and high performing organization, resilient business operations, and faster and better decisions.

3. Discuss how the Lindesnes principles can be applied to solve the challenges described in the scenario
