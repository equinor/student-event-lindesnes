# Equinor & SAP NextGen Student event - Lindesnes case work

## What is Lindesnes?

Lindesnes is a collection of principles that guide and align people in how to use information technology (IT) to enable a learning and high performing organization, resilient business operations, and faster and better decisions.


## Case work

We want to introduce you to the Lindesnes principles and ask you to apply the principles to a real life scenario. 

1. Browse through the [Lindesnes principles](Lindesnes%20-%20Principles.pdf)
2. Read through the [scenario](Lindesnes%20%E2%80%93%20Scenarios.pdf) 
3. Discuss how the Lindesnes principles can be applied to solve the challenges described in the scenario
4. Prepare a short (3 minute) presentation of your work. You decide the format of your presentation, but we do not want you to use a PC/slideshow for the presentation.
